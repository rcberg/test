# a haiku for robert

this is my class test

'hello world': that's what i say

i will never know

In The Rain-  
in the rain-  
darkness,     the sunset  
being sheathed i sit and  
think of you  

the holy  
city which is your face  
your little cheeks the streets  
of smiles  

your eyes half-  
thrush  
half-angel and your drowsy  
lips where float flowers of kiss  

and  
there is the sweet shy pirouette  
your hair  
and then  

your dancesong  
soul.     rarely-beloved  
a single star is  
uttered,and i  

think  
       of you  
       
       --EE Cummings
